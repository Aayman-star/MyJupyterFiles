Far away is the land of rest
Thousand miles are stretched between
Many a mountain's stormy crest
Many a desert void of green

Wasted worn is the traveller
Dark his heart and dim his eye
Without hope or comforter
Faltering faint and ready to die

Often he looks to the ruthless sky
Often he looks o'er his dreary road
Often he wishes down to lie
And render up life's tiresome load

But yet faint not mournful man
Leagues on leagues are left behind
Since your sunless course began
Then go on to toil resigned

If you still despair control
Hush its whispers in your breast
You shall reach the final goal
You shall win the land of rest

I die, but when the grave shall press
    The heart so long endeared to thee,
When earthly cares no more distress
    And earthly joys are nought to me,

Weep not, but think that I have passed
    Before thee o'er a sea of gloom,
Have anchored safe, and rest at last
    Where tears and mourning cannot come.

'Tis I should weep to leave thee here
On the dark ocean sailing drear,
With storms around and fears before,
And no kind light to point the shore.

But long or short though life may be,
'Tis nothing to eternity:
We part below to meet on high,
Where blissful ages never die.
